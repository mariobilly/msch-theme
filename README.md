## Included nodes

| Node | What it does |
|---|---|
| Browser extension | Apply the MSCH carbon, steel, bone and acid-accent palette to compatible custom node cards. |

## Installation

Clone into `ComfyUI/custom_nodes`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mariobilly/msch-theme.git
```

Open a terminal in the cloned folder and install requirements using **the same Python environment as ComfyUI**:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Windows portable, from `ComfyUI_windows_portable`:

```powershell
.\python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install -r .\ComfyUI\custom_nodes\msch-theme\requirements.txt
```

Restart ComfyUI and refresh the browser. Load a JSON workflow from `examples/` and select the supplied demo input or your own media. Keep only one installed copy of each package to avoid duplicate node registrations.

## Requirements and behavior

This browser extension has no executable graph nodes or rendered video output. It themes matching MSCH node types after restart and browser refresh. Theme appearance depends on the ComfyUI frontend and node-card rendering mode.

See the [extension guide](docs/EXTENSION.md) for behavior and usage. This package has no graph-node render output.

## Documentation and examples

[docs/NODES.md](docs/NODES.md) documents every input, default, range, choice and output. [examples/README.md](examples/README.md) explains which inputs and other nodes each workflow needs and how the included results were produced.

## ComfyUI Manager

The release includes Comfy Registry metadata and a GitHub publishing action. **Publisher `mariobilly` is configured; Registry publication is pending the publishing secret and a successful publish run**. A separate [ComfyUI Manager node-list registration](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI-Manager/pull/3247) has been submitted; listing is pending maintainer acceptance. Git installation works independently. See [PUBLISHING.md](PUBLISHING.md).

## Validation

Imports and input schemas were checked against the local ComfyUI environment with Python 3.12.10, PyTorch 2.10 and CUDA available. Example render coverage is documented per workflow; this is not a claim of compatibility testing on every platform or of full MiniMax H3 model-generation validation.
